\section{Building}

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

\noindent The following is a list of requirements to build and use the libraries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item C (c17) and C++ (c++20) compiler,
    \item CMake 3.27
    \item GNU Make (optional)
    \item clang-tidy (optional)
    \item cppcheck (optional)
\end{itemize}
\noindent Supported compilers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item gcc (mingw and msys2 are supported for Windows\texttrademark)
    \item clang (llvm and clang-cl is supported)
    \item cl.exe (msvc)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preparing the build}

This project uses CMake and supplies a list of presets. The most straightforward way to build the project is by using the provided Makefile and invoking it as follows:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    $ \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{make}} prepare
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent Note that configuring and generating recipes using CMake directly -- without using the provided Makefiles -- will not use the supplied configuration options. If you wish to replicate it, you may want to use the following options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release|
    \item \verb|-DCLM_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF|
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Building using CMake}

If you used the previously mentioned \texttt{make} command, you can simply invoke it with the \texttt{build} recipe as follows:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    $ \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{make}} build
\end{Verbatim}
